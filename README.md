# molcpp
Molcpp is a C++ library for storing and manipulating molecular data. It provides a fast and efficient data structure for storing atomic coordinates, molecular topology, and other molecular properties. Molcpp is designed to be used as the core data structure for the [molpy](https://github.com/Roy-Kid/molpy) Python package, but can also be used as a standalone library for other molecular modeling applications.
